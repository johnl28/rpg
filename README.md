- You will be spawned as an adventurer, which will have to save his world from the goblins. There will be 3 different realms, in order to win you must kill each boss of the realm.
- Killing and collecting the items will gain you experience for level and power. Just beating the boss is not gonna bring you to the next realm, you must complete the spell puzzle using the stones gathered after killing the boss.
